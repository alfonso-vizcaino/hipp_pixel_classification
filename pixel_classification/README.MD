# Pixel classification code
## Data set 
   Data set is located at "./data" folder

## Dev, Val and Test set
   Dev, Val and Test set are generated in Notebook "./util/DatasetGenerator_Notebook.ipynb"

---
## Data standarization
   Dev data set is standardized (scaled) in Notebook "./util/DatasetScalerGenerator_Notebook.ipynb"

---
## ML models

### MLP, SVM, RBFN, and RF models
    ML models make use of the data set generated by the "DatasetGenerator_Notebook" and uses the mean and the std deviation calculated from the "DatasetScalerGenerator_Notebook"

### Models performances
   * For comparing models that use 14-D feature vector go to "./Comparison_14D"
   * For comparing models that use 7-D feature vector go to "./Comparison_7D"

    Metric results are printed at the bottom of the Notebook contained in those folders
